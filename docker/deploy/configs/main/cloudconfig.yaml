# PREREQUISITES:
#   - project PROJECT_ID on google cloud
#   - kube cluster in this project with exactly the same name: PROJECT_ID
#   - ConfigMap in the cluster named _APP with the required private
#     environment variables from './config.json' specified
#   - Ingress configuration which proxies port 80 to the serviceName _APP

# IMPORTANT:
#   - When copying to another project, you MUST change the variables below
#     (substitutions)
substitutions:
  # The kube cluster must have a ConfigMap with the _APP name
  # which has the required private env vars specified from ./config.json
  _APP: startupjs-ui
  _ZONE: us-east1-d
  # We are in a monorepo, so we have to specify the path to the
  # styleguide. In a regular project you won't need it
  # since everything is gonna be in the root (current) folder: '.'
  _PATH: ./styleguide

timeout: 2000s
steps:

- id: main deploy
  name: startupjs/deploy
  args: [batch]
  env:
  # pipe all user defined substitutions
  # you MUST specify each env variable from the `substitutions` section above
  - _APP=$_APP
  # pipe all default substitutions
